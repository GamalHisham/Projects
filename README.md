### Summary:

Using SQL, Python, Power BI, and Excel, I pulled order status data from the database and created a dashboard to analyze Campaign performance


### Objective:

Create a comprehensive report to analyze the key metrics (Impressions, CTR, Clicks, CPC, Spend, Conversions, and Engagements), Provide insights into each campaign's effectiveness, and identify optimization opportunities.

A handful of KPIs were provided to analyze the data, but I have created additional KPIs like ROAS (Return on ad spend) and Conversion Rate to gain more insights.

### Methodology:

1. SQL query that extracts, cleans, and transforms the data from the database.

2. Build a dashboard in Power BI.

3. Conduct a more detailed  analysis in Python to analyze campaign performance.

### Skills:

1. Power BI: Dax, writing functions, ETL, calculated columns, data visualization, data modeling

### Results & Business Recommendation:

✅ Campaign Performance:

The summer campaign has the highest Return on Ad Spend (ROAS) and Conversion Rate, indicating it’s delivering the most value for the money spent

The fall campaign is engaging but not generating revenue, possibly due to issues with the landing page

✅ Channel Effectiveness:

Facebook has the highest spend but is generating low revenue compared to other channels

Pinterest, despite the lower investment, has generated high revenue, suggesting an opportunity to increase investment

✅ Device Optimization:

Desktop devices have shown consistent performance and the highest ROI, suggesting a reallocation of budget towards desktop advertising

Mobile devices need ad optimization to improve ROAS

✅ Geographic Performance:

Birmingham has achieved the highest ROAS with the lowest spending, indicating efficient targeting or strong audience alignment

London is underperforming, which may require a review and adjustment of targeting strategies


These insights can guide strategic decisions to optimize marketing campaigns for better performance and ROI.
